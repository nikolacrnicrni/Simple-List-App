## Key features

-Use this REST api for getting the results: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

-Create a simple one screen application with scrollable table view.

-Display REST api results in table view - cell should contain information from json response.

-Tapping on cell opens dialog showing the same data.

-Please use paging to make sure that loading and scrolling is smooth (load while scrolling is preferred).

-Use Room or ORM of your choice for persisting data for offline use.

-Add pull to refresh action to the table view.

-Please make sure to prepare the app in a way which makes it simple to add features.

-Prepare the app for 3 environments (dev, staging and prod) - you can use the same url for all three, this is not important.

-Make sure that you use the Material Design UI.

-Add unit tests.
